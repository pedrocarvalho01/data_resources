## Study Plan Ideas

### My goal:
My objective here is to become the best data analyst one can be.
<br></br>

### How to achieve that goal:<br>
In order to achieve this I understand that I still need to learn many different things. <br>
The way I will do in order to learn all that is by:<br>
  a) identifying what there is to learn<br>
  b) read about in the internet about the topic in general terms<br>
  c) read a book in that topic<br>
  d) if the book is confusing or too complex: watch some videos on that topic, and if needed, take a course in that topic<br>
  e) **the most important:** create a notebook in that topic showing a small project on how that topic is applied in data analytics scenarios<br>
<br></br>

### Topics that I need to tackle to achieve my goal, in order from the most important to less important:
  1) Kaggle notebooks: this is important as I will be using kaggles notebooks as my projects notebooks. This is a important part of my presentation skills to show the world what I am learning and how I am doing it.
  2) Gather data: using APIs and other different data sources
  3) Model data and create a complex dataset for analysis: this dataset is important as it will be used on most of our demonstrations and analysis.
  5) Data Visualization: create a notebook with some major key visualizations, why to use them, and how to use them.
  6) SQL practice: create a notebook to share common SQL practices, like self joins, joins, cross products, union, except, etc.
  7) Data Manipulation, data cleansing: create a notebook showing common practices on how to clean data.
  8) Preparing data for analysis: create a notebook taking chapter 2 of SQL book* (see notes)
  9) Time series analysis SQL
  10) Cohort analysis SQL
  11) Text analysis SQL
  12) Anomaly detection SQL
  13) Experiment analysis SQL
  14) Data-driven decision SQL
  15) Exploratory data analysis  SQL: create a notebook showing common uses for exploratory data analysis.
  16) Descriptive analytics SQL
  17) Diagnostic analytics SQL
  18) Predictive analytics SQL
  19) Prescriptive analytics SQL
  20) A/B testing SQL
  21) Hypothesis Testing SQL
