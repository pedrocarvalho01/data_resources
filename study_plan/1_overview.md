## Study Plan Ideas

### My goal:
My objective here is to become the best data analyst one can be. <br>
<br>
### How to achieve that goal:<br>
In order to achieve this I understand that I still need to learn many different things. <br>
The way I will do in order to learn all that is by:<br>
  a) identifying what there is to learn<br>
  b) read about in the internet about the topic in general terms<br>
  c) read a book in that topic<br>
  d) if the book is confusing or too complex: watch some videos on that topic, and if needed, take a course in that topic<br>
  e) **the most important:** create a notebook in that topic showing a small project on how that topic is applied in data analytics scenarios<br>

### Topics that I need to tackle to achieve my goal, in order from the most important to less important:
  1) Kaggle notebooks: this is important as I will be using kaggles notebooks as my projects notebooks. This is a important part of my presentation skills to show the world what I am learning and how I am doing it.
  2) Creating a complex dataset for analysis: this dataset is important as it will be used on most of our demonstrations and analysis.
  3) Data Visualization: create a notebook with some major key visualizations, why to use them, and how to use them.
  4) SQL practice: create a notebook to share common SQL practices, like self joins, joins, cross products, union, except, etc.
  5) Data Manipulation, data cleansing: create a notebook showing common practices on how to clean data.
  6) Preparing data for analysis: create a notebook taking chapter 2 of SQL book* (see notes)
  7) Time series analysis SQL
  9) Cohort analysis SQL
  10) Text analysis SQL
  11) Anomaly detection SQL
  12) Experiment analysis SQL
  13) Data-driven decision SQL
  14) Exploratory data analysis: create a notebook showing common uses for exploratory data analysis.
  15) Descriptive analytics
  16) Diagnostic analytics
  17) Predictive analytics 
  18) Prescriptive analytics
  19)
