### My goal:
My objective here is to become the best data analyst one can be. <br>

  a) identifying what there is to learn<br>
  b) read about in the internet about the topic in general terms<br>
  c) read a book in that topic<br>
  d) if the book is confusing or too complex: watch some videos on that topic, and if needed, take a course in that topic<br>
  e) **the most important:** create a notebook in that topic showing a small project on how that topic is applied in data analytics scenarios<br>
