## Study Plan Ideas

### My goal:
My objective here is to become the best data analyst one can be.
<br></br>

### How to achieve that goal:<br>
In order to achieve this I understand that I still need to learn many different things. <br>
The way I will do in order to learn all that is by:<br>
  a) identifying what there is to learn<br>
  b) read about in the internet about the topic in general terms<br>
  c) read a book in that topic<br>
  d) if the book is confusing or too complex: watch some videos on that topic, and if needed, take a course in that topic<br>
  e) **the most important:** create a notebook in that topic showing a small project on how that topic is applied in data analytics scenarios<br>
<br></br>

### Topics that I need to tackle to achieve my goal, in order from the most important to less important:
  1) Kaggle notebooks: this is important as I will be using kaggles notebooks as my projects notebooks. This is a important part of my presentation skills to show the world what I am learning and how I am doing it.
  2) Functional analysis, requirement gathering.
  3) Gather data: using APIs and other different data sources
  4) Data Manipulation, data cleansing: create a notebook showing common practices on how to clean data.
  6) Data warehouse vs Data Lake
  7) Understand Data Models, the dimensional model (scd2, facts, dim, etc), how to read an Entity Relationship model, 3NF.
  8) Model data and create a complex dataset for analysis: this dataset is important as it will be used on most of our demonstrations and analysis.
  9) ETL, ELT, keeping your dataset up to date.
  10) Cubes
  11) Data Visualization: create a notebook with some major key visualizations, why to use them, and how to use them.
  12) SQL practice: create a notebook to share common SQL practices, like self joins, joins, cross products, union, except, etc.
  13) Preparing data for analysis: create a notebook taking chapter 2 of SQL book* (see notes)
  14) Time series analysis SQL
  15) Cohort analysis SQL
  16) Text analysis SQL
  17) Anomaly detection SQL
  18) Experiment analysis SQL
  19) Data-driven decision SQL
  20) Exploratory data analysis  SQL: create a notebook showing common uses for exploratory data analysis.
  21) Descriptive analytics SQL
  22) Diagnostic analytics SQL
  23) Predictive analytics SQL
  24) Prescriptive analytics SQL
  25) A/B testing SQL
  26) Hypothesis Testing SQL
  27) UAT testing
